Definition polynomial := list R.

(* Example: Representing f(x) = 3 + 2x - 5x^2 *)
Definition example_poly : polynomial := [3; 2; -5].

(* Function to count the number of strictly positive roots *)
(* Note: This function will depend on roots finding, which is complex *)
Parameter Z : polynomial -> nat.

(* Lemma: If a_n * a_0 > 0, then Z(f) is even; if a_n * a_0 < 0, then Z(f) is odd *)
Lemma even_odd_Z :
  forall (f : polynomial) (a0 an : R),
  (hd 0 f = a0) ->
  (hd 0 (rev f) = an) ->
  if Rlt_dec (a0 * an) 0 then Nat.odd (Z f) = true
  else Nat.even (Z f) = true.
Proof.
  (* Outline of the proof:
     - Consider the behavior of the polynomial f(x) at 0 and infinity.
     - If f(0) > 0 and f(∞) > 0, the number of positive roots must be even.
     - If f(0) < 0 and f(∞) > 0, the number of positive roots must be odd.
     - Use intermediate value theorem or similar to formalize crossing behavior.

(* Main theorem: Descartes's rule of signs *)
Theorem descartes_rule_of_signs :
  forall (f : polynomial),
  Z f <= V f /\ Nat.even (V f - Z f).
Proof.
  (* Outline of the proof:
     - Base case: n = 0 or n = 1, trivial.
     - Inductive step:
       + Assume the theorem holds for f'.
       + Use Rolle's theorem to show the relationship between Z(f) and Z(f').
       + Consider cases for V(f') depending on the signs of coefficients.
       + Show that Z(f) and V(f) have the same parity.
       + Conclude Z(f) <= V(f).

      assert (H : Z f' <= V f' /\ Nat.even (V f' - Z f')) by apply IHf'.
