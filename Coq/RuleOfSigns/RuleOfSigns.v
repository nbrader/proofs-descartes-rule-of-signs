(* Definition of a polynomial as a list of coefficients *)
Definition polynomial := list R.

(* Example: Polynomial 3 - 2x + 4x^2 would be represented as [3; -2; 4] *)
Definition example_poly : polynomial := [3; -2; 4].

(* Function to calculate the number of sign changes in the polynomial *)
Fixpoint count_sign_changes (p : polynomial) : nat :=
  match p with
  | [] => 0
  | [_] => 0
  | a :: b :: rest =>
      if Rltb (a * b) 0 then 1 + count_sign_changes (b :: rest)
      else count_sign_changes (b :: rest)
  end.

(* Function to compute the derivative of a polynomial *)
Fixpoint derivative (p : polynomial) : polynomial :=
  match p with
  | [] => []
  | [_] => []
  | a :: rest =>
      let fix derivative_aux p n :=
          match p with
          | [] => []
          | h :: t => (h * n) :: derivative_aux t (n + 1)
          end
      in derivative_aux rest 1
  end.

(* Evaluate polynomial at a given point *)
Fixpoint eval_poly (p : polynomial) (x : R) : R :=
  match p with
  | [] => 0
  | a :: rest => a + x * (eval_poly rest x)
  end.

(* A helper function for counting positive roots *)
Fixpoint count_positive_roots (p : polynomial) : nat :=
  (* We would use this function within the inductive proof *)
  0. (* Placeholder, as the actual implementation depends on deeper analysis *)
